## My process

- Checked README.md file and style-guide.md
- Created styles.css and connected it to index.html
- Make changes at HTML file and add all needed elements and text
- Styled everything with plain CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This is one of the easiest projects on Frontend Mentor, so I just spent a couple mintutes trying to make it same as on the provided image without real design where I could check actaul properties.

### Continued development

I would like to write better CSS in the future examples. This was very small project so I didn't want tu use Sass or anything similar.
